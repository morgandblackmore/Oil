# Oil
Repo for first group project

Thesis: Oil is the worlds most important commodity and it has a uniquely large impact on the world economy and financial markets.  We are seeing this play out today as Russia's war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions have led to volatility both at the pump and in portfolios.
Approach: Our group will look at oil through other periods of crisis, how it behaves relative to other commodities, renewables, etc.  How exactly we will examine oil will depend on each group member choosing an analysis that interests them.
Immediate next steps:
Each member will decide what to focus their analysis on.  Goal- do by 3/28
Create a GitHub repo for the project. I volunteer to take care of this. Goal- do by 3/30
