# Oil

**Thesis:** Oil is the worlds most important commodity and it has a uniquely large impact on the world economy and financial markets.  We are seeing this play out today as Russia's war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions have led to volatility both at the pump and in portfolios.  

**Approach:** Our group will look at oil through other periods of crisis, how it behaves relative to other commodities, renewables, etc.  How exactly we will examine oil will depend on each group member choosing an analysis that interests them.
